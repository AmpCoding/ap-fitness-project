            <h2>INITIAL ASSESMENT</h2>
            <p>
            The initial process is as follows: Once payment is made, I will ask for your height,
    weight and age to calculate your DCE (Daily Caloric Expenditure) and devise a meal
    plan for your fitness journey. Next, I will need 4 current pictures of all angles
    (front, back and both sides) wearing a bikini or underwear and sports bra emailed to
    <em>APFitnessStudio@gmail.com</em>. I will assess where you are today and determine
    what you need to do to get to your body goals. You will then receive a workout
    regimen designed specifically for YOU! This is the personal touch I offer for all of my
    clients.

    meal prep which truly is a key aspect of the success you will achieve during your
    fitness journey. I will tell you when it's time to make any adjustments to your food,
